           <p>An excellent drama set in the 1800s about the love affair between a painter and her subject, both women, with one woman not knowing she is the subject of a painting. Although the movie contains only female speaking roles, the backdrop of male dominance looms over the characters in a time heavily oppressed by the patriarchal system. With Marianne the painter being forced to display her work under her father’s name. The subject of the painting, Héloïse is a woman of high social rank on her way to be married, yet she feels hopeless at the lack of choice she has in the matter. This subtle touch is not in the foreground of the movie but provides a bittersweet theme to an otherwise beautiful love story. </p>
           <p>What made this movie truly remarkable was the cinematography; excellent colour coordination, subtle lighting, and a great use of directing the viewer's eyes to where they need to be. The use of art as an object and lens through which we see the movie through, gives the motions and cinematography of the movie a captivating quality; allowing the viewer to immerse themselves in this visual journey. Although most period pieces would use traditional film, I felt as though the use of digital cameras modernised the film and gave it a refreshing, clear look. </p>
           <p>Although you can have a sense of where the movie is headed when watching it, it steers away from certain narrative / romantic cliches giving respect to the audience. It allows for the characters to breathe and lets the audience take time to analyse the distinct facial expressions and movements the characters make. This gives the story a feeling of delicacy with a very moving but not over the top ending to the story.
        </p>
           <p>A vivid, sometimes hyper-real depiction of forbidden love and a great piece of French cinema.</p>
