        <p>Two unjoined stories of police officers finding love in unlikely ways and places. Cop 223 an undercover police officer finds comfort with a woman of the underground world. Cop 633 mends his broken heart when finding an ethereal server at a late night store who begins to spruce up his life without his knowing. All the characters in this movie seem like everyday working people living their own lives, people you may walk by everyday but never take notice. But you can never know what a random meeting can lead to. 
        </p>
        <p>Two unconnected stories may seem jarring at first and the second half may be more iconic but neither would feel complete without the other. The story requires both uneven halves to feel like a complete story of the city it takes place in. A city where the characters can be close enough to feel at home but still too far away to grasp at. Few cities feel as alive as Wong Kar-Waiâ€™s Hong-Kong, seen through a kaleidoscope of bright neon colours and handheld cinematography. 
        </p>
        <p>Chungking Express makes for an incredibly satisfying film due to its imperfections; a messy and sketchy film but everything seems to feel right by the end of it, everything has its place. Nothing ever truly unifies the 4 main characters but between them they show a connection in their city where being happy-sad is a state of being. Excellent acting especially by the contrasted leading ladies. A movie filmed in sequence with most scenes being written the night before or the morning of the day of filming, a dreamy story of love, loss, and chance. All vibes, no story.
