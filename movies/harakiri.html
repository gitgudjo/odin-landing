        <p>A film critiquing what is known as the Bushido Code, the honour code amongst samurai.</p>
        <p>Through the storytelling of this film director Masaki Kobayashi is able to strike a balance between what is honour and illusion. It discusses the hypocrisy in those who strictly adhere to the codes of conduct and shows how an unyielding loyalty to tradition, despite its outward facing nobility can still be abused for inhumane actions.</p>
        <p>The film is set in a time of feudal Japan where many large clans have crumbled without their leaders, leaving retainers to become jobless samurais (ronin). These ronin are forced to become mercenaries but in a time of peace within Japan they are often left impoverished. Tales spread that a ronin wishing to commit harakiri (seppuku) within the forecourt of the Iyi clan was instead offered employment. Other poverty stricken ronin follow in his footsteps like ants to a mound of sugar, bluffing the act of harakiri in hopes of charity.

        </p>
        <p>What is more dishonourable—a ronin asking a clan to perform harakiri in their courtyard in an effort to find work—or those in houses abusing them? The film very gradually gives insight into the importance of this tale within a tale through the use of flashbacks and flashbacks within flashbacks. A layered story slowly revealing itself to the antagonist and viewer where an alternative masculine archetype is revealed in the second act, one of a loving husband and father.</p>
    <p>The use of real, heavy, and unblunted samurai swords within the film is apparent within fight scenes giving each swing literal and figurative weight. More excruciating than the physical violence is the psychological tension built up throughout the final third act. A thought provoking glimpse into the inhumane mentality that led to Japan’s actions in WWII. A must-watch.
