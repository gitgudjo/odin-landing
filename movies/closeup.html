        <p>The true story of a man so invested in the art of cinema he fraudulently impersonates famous Iranian director Mohsen Makhmalbaf to convince a family to star in his “new film”. A fiction and documentary intertwined into an illusive layered investigation into identity and artistic creation. There was never a moment when watching when I was certain I was watching a movie or a documentary. The film relies heavily on self-aware dialogue without becoming annoyingly “meta” as it is used in an experimental form of story-telling.
        </p>
        <p> I could ramble about the concept of what makes a story like this real and what parts make it fabricated but for this film it is inconsequential. The director of this film did not look to make a report on this case to find the “truth”. He wanted to tell the story of a man who committed identity theft to feel respected and seen. “Art is a lie meant to tell the truth”. 
            </p>
        <p>Hossain Sabzian (the man convicted of fraud) uses his deception as an escape from his own reality. He was an impoverished man who related so deeply with the suffering portrayed in Makhmalbaf’s movies and so many other pieces of art that he chose to use his deceit as a form of self care not out of bitterness but as way to get a brief glimpse of what the elite of his society feel like. He had no financial motive, he enjoyed being heard, seen, and he says most importantly, respected. He may have only been pretending to be Makmalbaf, but a captive audience that believes his fake identity legitimises his fraud and thus Sabzian speaks it into existence.  
        </p>
        <p>It is unsure whether we are meant to feel sorry for Sabzian, he fooled many people, toying with their emotions. At times, in the “close-up” shots of him in the courtroom it compels the viewer to question whether he is simply continuing the act but as a slightly different role. Close-Up is an excellent minimalist portrayal of the class divide and shows how great cinema can affect people on all social standings. Highly recommend it if you are looking for an experimental, thought provoking watch.
