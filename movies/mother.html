        <p>Parasite brought me here, this is another of Bong Joon Ho’s masterfully crafted stories. Although this is only the second of his works that I’ve seen, you can see a similarity in the way Bong tells a story even with a completely new storyline. 
        </p>
        <p>Mother tells the story of unconditional love and its upsides and downsides. The story follows the character who we only ever know as “mother” in her quest to prove her sons innocence when wrongly imprisoned. Along this unusual mystery film storyline you come across a range of unorthodox supporting characters, in which the mother and the viewer must decide how much trust they should be given. The character development throughout the film feels natural and involves the viewer and their captivation. The characters are still somewhat enigmatic but the way in which the characters reveal who they are and what they are truly capable of makes for some great cinema.
        </p>
        <p>Many of the details or clues may seem straightforward but Bong uses them as a way to subvert your expectations and continue to build suspense. From the overall arc of proving Yoon’s innocence and finding the killer, to small discoveries that can feel suffocating; Bong is an expert of keeping the viewer’s attention, to reveal quiet gut-wrenching twists. With the somewhat confusing opening shot eventually becoming one of the last scenes in the film, being able to appreciate the shot again with the added context makes for a great moment. I can definitely recommend this especially if you’re a fan of his most famous work Parasite.
