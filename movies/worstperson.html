        <p>Not your usual romantic comedy. A contemporary piece of work with a great structure holding it together. Technically the third movie in a trilogy of loosely connected films but I was only made aware of this after having watched and it stands on its own very well. </p>
    <p>The story is structured in a prologue, 12 distinct chapters, followed by an epilogue. The prologue is short and to the point telling us everything we need to know about our protagonist Julie, struggling to stick to a career path or find a life goal, she is indecisive and looking to take control of her own life. In the movie we see how Julie is impulsive to a fault while remaining completely confident in her uncertainty.</p>
    <p>What may initially seem to be a slice-of-life film with a rather slow start becomes a more complex and thought provoking story. It discusses the paradox many humans experience of wanting to feel independent through the dependency of a relationship, and how you often end up hurting people more in an effort not to. This movie although given the genres “Romance, Comedy” is the antithesis to such movies, it shows romance as an extension to your personal life’s journey rather than another movie about finding your so-called “soul-mate”. It’s about finding your place in the world through the eyes of a woman who is confident in not becoming complacent. With some hilarious moments starkly contrasted with certain moments of despair. With one chapter simply being called “cheating” (utroskap) it pushes the boundaries of what is and isn’t cheating creating some very thought provoking blurred lines.</p>
<p>A very fun but realistic coming-of-age movie for adults, with some amazing actors and performances. A rom-com made for cynics, those that feel lonely, or those that havent found their place in the world yet. </p>
