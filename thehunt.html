    <div class="review">
       <p>An incredibly emotionally draining drama from Danish director Thomas Vinterberg. Based on a true story, this movie delivers a strong message about prejudice enough to move anyone. The film follows Lucas (portrayed by Mads Mikkelsen), a lonely kindergarten teacher who has a clear passion for his job and is loved by his local tight-knit community and the children he works with alike. Without revealing too much of the plot, one of his students, a 5 year-old by the name of Klara tells one lie that lands Lucas in immeasurable trouble.</p> 
       <p>The story that begins with just a harmless misunderstanding teaches the viewer about the dangers behind the mob mentality, mass hysteria, and the sensation of vilifying someone. It is able to teach a lesson on our general ignorance and how quickly we are able to accept things as truth. It shows the importance of careful consideration and doubt.

        This movie is truly a one-man show, although having a great set of supporting characters, Mads Mikkelsen is essentially on-screen throughout the entirety of this movie's two hour run time. His restrained acting of a man under the midst of a witch hunt is quite remarkable. Mads’s subtleties in his acting through his facial expression are what really sell the character and is ultimately what makes this movie so memorable. The cinematography may not be something you notice at first but upon reviewing it, I felt the natural lighting played well into the realistic story and the shift from warmer natural lighting into the darker more shadowy lighting carried the tension of the second act well. 
        </p>
       <p>Despite being a film with no action, Thomas Vinterberg is able to build constant mental pressure on the viewer, which at times this tension can feel overwhelming but it is still a must-see psychological thriller that will stick with you long after watching it. </p>
