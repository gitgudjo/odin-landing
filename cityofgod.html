        <p>One of my favourite films from this list, City of God, is an excellent portrayal of life in the slums (favelas) of Rio de Janeiro. The plot follows several characters with stories spanning over two decades from the 1960s to 1980s, showing how gang violence and drug wars shifted their lives For better or for worse. The story is mainly seen through the eyes of a young photographer, Buscapé somehow finds himself in the middle of this despite trying to avoid it his whole life. 
        </p>
        <p>Despite the several characters introduced throughout the movie's two hour runtime every character seems vital and plays an important part in the story. Innovatively the story follows the journey of every single character, watching it evokes a feeling of sonder as each character feels complex and layered, giving each character's actions more meaning. The use of the protagonist's voice for narration orientates the film and helps new storylines never feel scattered.
        </p>
        <p>City of God has some extremely raw cinematography and polished, captivating editing, paired with an incredible performance from the cast. Specifically the work done by the child actors portraying the characters younger selves is great. Machine gun cuts and quick flashy edits may seem over the top at first but the way this movie can speed through a character's storyline without losing focus and without falling into complete chaos is unmatched. 
        </p>
        <p>City of God utilises one of my favourite movie “tricks” of having a captivating opening scene without any context only for the scene to come back in the last act with the added context and atmosphere. The movie has thematic disputes from family, brotherhood, and justice without the need for a literal speech discussing what's right and what's wrong. These themes never feel too weighty however and through very interesting narrative structures the depth of the film never feels cumbersome. A great watch for on your own but also a great movie to watch with friends.
